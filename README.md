### ‚ÑπÔ∏èDATA PROFESSIONALS SURVEY BREAKDOWN

#### Project Overview

I completed a Power BI dashboard project using survey data from 630 data professionals across various countries. The objective was to analyze trends in job roles, salary, work satisfaction, and technical preferences in the data industry.

#### Project Objectives

1. Analyze the distribution of professionals by country and job title
2. Understand salary trends across roles and genders
3. Visualize job satisfaction in terms of salary and work-life balance
4. Identify the most preferred programming languages in the industry
5. Evaluate how difficult it was for respondents to break into data roles

#### What I Did

1. Imported and cleaned the dataset using Power Query Editor to remove inconsistencies and ensure proper data types
2. Created calculated columns and DAX measures to compute:

   * Average salary by job title and gender
   * Overall average age
   * Count of survey responses
   * Average satisfaction scores
3. Built interactive visuals using:

   * Bar charts (average salary by job title)
   * Treemaps (country-wise response distribution)
   * Donut charts (entry difficulty analysis)
   * Gauge charts (satisfaction scores)
   * Column charts (programming language popularity)
4. Added filters and slicers for dynamic user interaction
5. Customized layout and design for a user-friendly, informative, and visually engaging dashboard

#### Key Insights

1. Most respondents were from the United States, followed by India and the UK
2. Data Scientists had the highest average salary among job roles
3. Python was the most preferred programming language
4. Average respondent age was approximately 29.87 years
5. Average work-life balance score was 5.74/10; salary satisfaction was lower at 4.27/10
6. Over 42% of respondents found it difficult to break into the data field

#### Skills Demonstrated

* Data Import & Cleaning (Power Query)
